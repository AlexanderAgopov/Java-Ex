		In computing, plain text is a loose term for data (e.g. file contents)
		that represent only characters of readable material but not its
		graphical representation nor other objects (floating-point numbers,
		images, etc.). <img src="download.jpeg" alt="natural scene"
			style="float: left; width: 320; height: 200">It may also
		include a limited number of characters that control simple arrangement
		of text, such as spaces, line breaks, or tabulation characters
		(although tab characters can "mean" many different things, so are
		hardly "plain"). Plain text is different from formatted text, where
		style information is included; from structured text, where structural
		parts of the document such as paragraphs, sections, and the like are
		identified); and from binary files in which some portions must be
		interpreted as binary objects (encoded integers, real numbers, images,
		etc.). The term is sometimes used quite loosely, to mean files that
		contain only "readable" content (or just files with nothing that the
		speaker doesn't prefer). For example, that could exclude any
		indication of fonts or layout (such as markup, markdown, or even
		tabs); characters such as curly quotes, non-breaking spaces, soft
		hyphens, em dashes, and/or ligatures; or other things. In principle,
		plain text can be in any encoding, but occasionally the term is taken
		to imply ASCII. As Unicode-based encodings such as UTF-8 and UTF-16
		become more common, that usage may be shrinking. plain text is also
		sometimes used only to exclude "binary" files: those in which at least
		some parts of the file cannot be correctly interpreted via the
		character encoding in effect. For example, a file or string consisting
		of "hello" (in whatever encoding), following by 4 bytes that express a
		binary integer that is not just a character, is a binary file, not
		plain text by even the loosest common usages. Put another way,
		translating a plain text file to a character encoding that uses
		entirely different number to represent characters, does not change the
		meaning (so long as you know what encoding is in use), but for binary
		files such a conversion does change the meaning of at least some parts
		of the file. Files that contain markup or other meta-data are
		generally considered plain-text, so long as the markup is also in
		directly human-readable form (as in HTML, XML, and so on (as Coombs,
		Renear, and DeRose argue,[1] punctuation is itself markup; and no one
		considers punctuation to disqualify a file from being plain text). The
		use of plain text rather than binary files, enables files to survive
		much better "in the wild", in part by making them largely immune to
		computer architecture incompatibilities. For example, all the problems
		of Endianness can be avoided (with encodings such as UCS-2 rather than
		UTF-8, endianness matters, but uniformly for every character, rather
		than for potentially-unknown subsets of it).

	<p id="p2">Files that contain markup or other meta-data are
		generally considered plain-text, as long as the entirety remains in
		directly human-readable form (as in HTML, XML, and so on (as Coombs,

		plain text rather than bit-streams to express markup, enables files to
		survive much better "in the wild", in part by making them largely
		immune to computer architecture incompatibilities. According to The
		Unicode Standard, "Plain text is a pure sequence of character codes;
		plain Ue-encoded text is therefore a sequence of Unicode character
		codes." styled text, also known as rich text, is any text
		representation containing plain text completed by information such as
		a language identifier, font size, color, hypertext links.[2] For
		instance, rich text such as SGML, RTF, HTML, XML, wiki markup, and TeX
		rely on plain text. According to The Unicode Standard, plain text has
		two main properties in regard to rich text: "plain text is the
		underlying content stream to which formatting can be applied." "Plain
		text is public, standardized, and universally readable.".[2]</p>

	<p id="p3">Before the early 1960s, computers were mainly used for
		number-crunching rather than for text, and memory was extremely
		expensive. Computers often allocated only 6 bits for each character,
		permitting only 64 characters—assigning codes for A-Z, a-z, and 0-9
		would leave only 2 codes: nowhere near enough. Most computers opted
		not to support lower-case letters. Thus, early text projects such as
		Roberto Busa's Index Thomisticus, the Brown Corpus, and others had to
		resort to conventions such as keying an asterisk preceding letters
		actually intended to be upper-case. Fred Brooks of IBM argued strongly
		for going to 8-bit bytes, because someday people might want to process
		text; and won. Although IBM used EBCDIC, most text from then on came
		to be encoded in ASCII, using values from 0 to 31 for (non-printing)
		control characters, and values from 32 to 127 for graphic characters
		such as letters, digits, and punctuation. Most machines stored
		characters in 8 bits rather than 7, ignoring the remaining bit or
		using it as a checksum. The near-ubiquity of ASCII was a great help,
		but failed to address international and linguistic concerns. The
		dollar-sign ("$") was not so useful in England, and the accented
		characters used in Spanish, French, German, and many other languages
		were entirely unavailable in ASCII (not to mention characters used in
		Greek, Russian, and most Eastern languages). Many individuals,
		companies, and countries defined extra characters as needed—often
		reassigning control characters, or using value in the range from 128
		to 255. Using values above 128 conflicts with using the 8th bit as a
		checksum, but the checksum usage gradually died out. These additional
		characters were encoded differently in different countries, making
		texts impossible to decode without figuring out the originator's
		rules. For instance, a browser might display ¬A rather than ` if it
		tried to interpret one character set as another. The International
		Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) eventually developed several
		code pages under ISO 8859, to accommodate various languages. The first
		of these (ISO 8859-1) is also known as"Latin-1", and covers the needs
		of most (not all) European languages that use Latin-based characters
		(there was not quite enough room to cover them all). ISO 2022 then
		provided conventions for"switching" between different character sets
		in mid-file. Many other organisations developed variations on these,
		and for many years Windows and Macintosh computers used incompatible
		variations. The text-encoding situation became more and more complex,
		leading to efforts by ISO and by the Unicode Consortium to develop a
		single, unified character encoding that could cover all known (or at
		least all currently known) languages. After some conflict,[citation
		needed] these efforts were unified. Unicode currently allows for
		1,114,112 code values, and assigns codes covering nearly all modern
		text writing systems, as well as many historical ones and for many
		non-linguistic characters such as printer's dingbats, mathematical
		symbols, etc.</p>
